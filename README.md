Here's some papers of adversarial attack in different kinds of tracks

This paper shows a method to enhance the robustness of models by mapping the penultimate layer features into a lower feature space, then minimize the inner-class distance and maximize the inter-class distance throght Lpc restraint with help of a trainable class centroids.
